# cmty-ssl-heartbleed-CVE-2014-0160-HTTP-HTTPS
Targets the OpenSSL product directly on discovered HTTP and HTTPS services. This does not check for OpenSSL 1.0.2-beta which is vulnerable. Also, OpenSSL is commonly packaged into other software and better targeted on any service responding using SSL. 

##### Note: This check is version checking and does not test the vulnerability directly. 

### Other Routes for detection. 
- discover and extract a list of ports and targets using SSL from `nmap -A -T4 --xml targets` 
Loop through target hosts with NMAP 6.3+ `nmap -sV -p targethostPorts --xml --script=ssl-heartbleed.nse targethost` 
- `masscan targethosts -p0-65535 --rate 100000 --heartbleed`
