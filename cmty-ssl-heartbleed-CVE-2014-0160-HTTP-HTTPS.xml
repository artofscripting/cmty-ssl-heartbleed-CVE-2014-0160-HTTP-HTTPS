  <Description>
     <p>Heartbleed is a security bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, which is a widely used implementation of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It was introduced into the software in 2012 and publicly disclosed in April 2014. Heartbleed may be exploited regardless of whether the vulnerable OpenSSL instance is running as a TLS server or client. It results from improper input validation (due to a missing bounds check) in the implementation of the TLS heartbeat extension.[3] Thus, the bug's name derives from heartbeat.[4] The vulnerability is classified as a buffer over-read, a situation where more data can be read than should be allowed</p>

      <summary>Upgrade OpenSSL</summary>
      <workaround>
        <p>Bodo Moeller and Adam Langley of Google prepared the fix for Heartbleed. The resulting patch was added to Red Hat's issue tracker on March 21, 2014.[35] Stephen N. Henson applied the fix to OpenSSL's version control system on April 7th.[36] The first fixed version, 1.0.1g, was released on the same day. Upgrade OpenSSL. </p>
